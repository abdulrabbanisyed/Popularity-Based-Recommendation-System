# Recommendation-System

This is a recommendation system being built to learn and understand how any recommender system works and how many types there are and with all inclusion a web application will be built and released.


Types of Recommendatation Systems:
  1. Popularity-Based
     a. Entirely based on trend
     b. Ranks the content based on user ratings, clicks.

To build Popularity-Based recommendation systems we need a criteria to build the system
  The possiblities of choosing your features depends on you, for example:
      1. Movie rating
      2. Number of views ; can be one of the criteria you can consider to build the recommendation system.

  3. Content-Based
      An article is read by user, there will be similar types of articles available and we need to recommend those articles to the user. That is based out of content we are recommending          the user. 
      It uses # Cosine Similarity to determine the closeness
          Euclidean Distance Measure and the dot product between data points
          The range of cosine similarity is between 0 and 1

        Steps:
          1. We need to convert unstructured data to structured format.
          2. We calculate cosine similarity to recommend the user
Terms required to understand content-based filtering are:
        1. Document term Frequency:
              How many times has the term occurred in the document?

        2. Normalization:
              How many times out of how many words occurred is called normalization
              
          
      
  4. collabarative filtering
      
  
  5. Hybrid approaches
